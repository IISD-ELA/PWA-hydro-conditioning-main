# PWA-hydro-conditioning-main

This repository provides a workflow to hydro-condition Prairie watersheds using the ```hydro_condition.py``` script. It is designed for use with the custom [PWA-hydro-conditioning-tools](https://github.com/IISD-ELA/PWA-hydro-conditioning-tools) Python package, and requires certain datasets as input.
